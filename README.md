For those who expected more BDSM related content in SWPT comes a mod that delivers that.

This mod adds a number of dungeon themed furniture items (Such as a pillory) to the game along with poses for proper "use".
To enhance the furniture, this mod also adds another interaction when selecting furniture option called "Add Character".
This option automatically creates a new randomly* generated character that is posing using the furniture.
It can be used on an occupied furniture to remove the character, deleting them if they are not a companion.
*NOTE: The option uses the first companion Kira as a base template for some options such as breast size, equipment, etc.
Modify her before adding a character for some control over the visuals.

Lastly, this mod adds some custom lingerie. Specifically a gag and nipple piercings. The various piercings only work within certain ranges of breast morphs for now.

This mod requires BepInEx to be installed for SWPT.
